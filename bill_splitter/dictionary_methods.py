# Anthony keeps track of what he eats: he writes down how many calories are in his meals.
# Use the list of dictionaries to calculate the total amount of calories per day and print it.
# The sample input will look like:
# meals = [
#         {"title": "Oatmeal pancakes with apple and cinnamon", "kcal": 370},
#         {"title": "Italian salad with fusilli and ham", "kcal": 320},
#         {"title": "Bulgur with vegetables", "kcal": 350},
#         {"title": "Curd souffle with lingonberries and ginger", "kcal": 225},
#         {"title": "Oatmeal with honey and peanuts", "kcal": 440}]
# The output in this case should be 1705.
