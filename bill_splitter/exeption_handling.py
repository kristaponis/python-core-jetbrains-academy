# Advanced input() handling is used to read input directly
# into several variables, e. g., name, surname = input().split(),
# but a user still can enter more or fewer words.
# In this task, you have to make sure that the user entered
# the necessary amount of words and... If there are more or fewer words
# in the input, print an error: "You need to enter exactly 2 words. Try again!"
# If everything's good, greet the user personally.
