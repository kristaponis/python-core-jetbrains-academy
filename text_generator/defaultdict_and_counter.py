# The Counter class provides some special methods that we
# didn't cover in the topic. Here, you will need to use the elements() function.
# Take a string from a user as input, turn it into lowercase and split it,
# create a Counter dictionary from it, and then print the sorted
# list of elements that the dictionary consists of.
# Sample Input:
# Chessboard is a square board divided into sixty-four.
# Sample Output:
# ['a', 'board', 'chessboard', 'divided', 'into', 'is', 'sixty-four', 'square']

# Emilia is working in a bank and she has data about some transactions.
# The transactions are given as a list of tuples named transactions
# where the first element of the tuple is the account id
# and the second â€” the sum spent in the transaction. Help Emilia turn
# this data into a dictionary where a key is an account id and its value is
# the list of the money spent in transactions. The sums of money on this list
# should be in their original order! The new dictionary should
# be named transaction_dict. For example, transaction_dict may look
# like this {546: [987.65]}. The value of the key 546 should be [987.65]
# because the account with the id 546 made only one transaction.
